## About me:
### I have been working and playing with computers since 1985.  I decided to update my skillset with cloud development early 2023 and enrolled in MITxPro's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.  
Even though I already had a pretty decent handle on JavaScript, they had me do several beginner exercises and they are what is in this repo.  Because of the type of work I do, I have no publicly available examples of my normal work.
